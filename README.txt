This is a basic README file that should be utilized as an aid to run the code that is
provided for this Machine Learning Project. It is reccommended that this code is run
in a Jupyter notebook compiler so that you are able to visualize the different
classifiers as well as graphs and tables that show valuable details of the program.

Ensure that all of the data .csv files indicated below are present within the same folder
as the ipynb file. Please press the restart kernel and run all button and then closely
follow the notebook as it runs each cell seperately to derive the most accurate solution.

Below are the .csv files that need to be present:

1950.csv
1960.csv
1970.csv
1980.csv
1990.csv
2000.csv
2010.csv
rankings.csv

Be sure to re-run the file if a given accuracy is too off from prediction or
provided values.
